(node:41614) [MODULE_TYPELESS_PACKAGE_JSON] Warning: Module type of file:///Users/shotah/Downloads/dot.Dev/SkillConnect/backend/demo-server.js is not specified and it doesn't parse as CommonJS.
Reparsing as ES module because module syntax was detected. This incurs a performance overhead.
To eliminate this warning, add "type": "module" to /Users/shotah/Downloads/dot.Dev/SkillConnect/backend/package.json.
